GIT IGNORE
	- .gitignore at the root of the project
	- I'm pretty sure all things in the ignore need to be defined relative to the root of the proj
	- WARN :: this only prevents new things from being picked up by git -- once tracked it doesn't work / matter
			-- see "git purge" for how to remove from tracking
	- ignore file
			readme.txt
	- ignore dir
			logs/
	- ignore pattern
			*.class
